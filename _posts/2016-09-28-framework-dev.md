The conference was great and I got lots of interest from many important
companies based in England. Hopefully this will turn out well!

## Trello and organising
The framework is getting quite complex, so I have decided to keep track
of the progress and of the tasks to complete using a Trello board.
This has helped enormously and I was aware I was going to need one soon, it
was just a matter of finding the time to create one and properly organise it.
Using the GTD method, I have separated the Inbox from the different
categories and long-term goals.
One of these goals is to have a basic version of a visibility buffer renderer
by mid-october; that way I can then iterate over it and add the triangle
culling and filtering.

## Research
At EGX I had the opportunity to discuss the visibility buffer with a 
graphics engineer at Creative Assembly who was very supportive and helpful
of my efforts towards testing this technique. It was very encouraging
to see someone of this rank genuinely interested in my project!
I have found some more supporting literature which shows how other people
had also implemented a technique very similar to the one explained by
Wolfgang; mainly in these papers what differs is the preparation of the
geometry before the actual visibility buffer filling pass.

The next step is to learn more about the filtering and culling since I
feel that I am getting close to fully understand how to implement it.
