This is a non-exhaustive list of books I would recommend game programming
students like me to read, or at least, to skim through:

* Effective C++ 3rd Ed
* Game Engine Architecture 2nd Ed
* Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics, 3rd Ed
* C++ Concurrency in Action
* 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game development
* Introducing Mechanics
* Real-Time Rendering, 3rd Ed
* Calculus: A complete course

I'll keep updating it and add links to Amazon, etc.
